# se-learning-assistant

## Building

Run the following commands

```bash
cd _plugins
bash build.sh
docker compose up --build
```

The application is accessible via port 3000.

## Big features of below summarized and prioritized

- Language adjustment in Translator!!!!
- Light theme!!!!!
- Public Deployment!!!!!
- Pronounciation plugin!!!
- User setting db&api
- Reading articles in Swedish
- Flexible storytelling!!
- Read whole ebook!!
- Discussions!!!
- Text writing support!!!

## Todo

- Project cleanup (title, pages, files) in main application
- Put plugins in own docker image to isolate them better (subdomain for plugins)
- apis should ckeck the cookies to ensure a logged in user accesses them
- a feature for writing text about a topic and correcting it bz having hints, like at SFI homework.

### Translator

- Make it wider
- more space before add button
- Move new search button somewhere else, maybe same line as heading (test it on sidebar too)
- If a search is triggered and then the new search button is pressed while searching is going on, it shows the "ask wuestions" input
- If second word is N/A or the same as the first skip it

### Flashcard training

- Show 4th category of words or add them to one of the other categories (cuttently the count is wrong)

### Settings

- Let plugins define a settings page and values are saved over api
- Iframe that renders this page (its too complicated to make all variations of settings possible)

#### SilentReading

- Loader before first chapter starts (is loading)
- option to include most difficult words from flashcard from a deck (it is not the topic, rather just words being used somehow in ther)

### Additional todo

- Saving preferences of user(db)
- maybe i really need a webworker plugin system too for headless actions like adding info to flashcards or reading info from db and providing it (eg storytelling wants to use most difficult flashcards of the newest deck)
- Attribute flaticons for their icons
- Customization of info behind "add to flashcard" action (just verb or also additional info,...)

#### Training !!!!!!

- displaying info in next line in flashcards does not work (its still in same line)
- After fullscreen got triggered and left you need to press twice to enter fullscreen again
- underline flashcard numbers top left which type of card gets displayed
- Add markdown editor to add flashcard sidebar

#### Reading articles in Swedish

- Scrap the web content by browsing page(copying all text, tab title and page name)
- Let chatgpt extract article by it telling which lines(from-till) belong to the article
- The copying converts it to markdown
- Let ai convert it to easy Swedish
- For now let it be working on pages where all text is wisible
- Alternatively the user can simply past in the whole page (primary usage for an mvp)

#### Sidebar for notes

- At the right of the screen are all sidebars with icons visible
- When clicking on it notes can be added (markdown)
- Files can be selecteda and in them stuff gets written down

#### chatgpt sidebar

- blank chat assistant with frontend action of adding something to flashcards/maybe notes
- one sidebar can trigger another sidebar. Every sidebar is own iframe
- icon showing which iframes are open
- or should i close them to save memory and power, i dont know yet

### Storytelling plugin - pronounciation

- AI prints chapter
- user reads out chapter aloud and corrects him (use api i mentioned below)
- It could be practical to listen to the words(own vs how it should sound) word splitup api from openai https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createTranscription?lang=curl

### Storytelling plugin - Flexible story development

- Based on stories in rimori (user defines how story continues)
- user writes or tells how story should continue (using swedish)
- Can just be orally or just be written or switches, one-by-one like in Rimori

# Resources

- User can add links to other pages for useful tools to learn swedish
- Up/down voting system (-5 and its out)
- Have categories and descriptions and comments

### Text writing support

- You have an assignment to write a text about a topic
- Then AI helps you with different things (word order, times, better words,....)
- Improvement rounds are happening after each other and people need to look up the word to find the right one (right time,...)
- How the UI looks like when the text is writtten I dont know
- Feedback ideas: https://moodle.folkuniversitetet.se/mod/page/view.php?id=611649&forceview=1

### User settings

- The plugin provides which settings exist
- Setting has properties (title, descriptions, type(bool, number, select on/many, text(regex)))
- Setting values are stored in the DB and are retrieveable via own settings client side api
- Settings page accessible through user icon drop down menu

### Storytelling plugin - small enhancements

- Adjustment of difficulty
- Using words already learned in the flashcards
- Have config parameter for AI backend(model,provider,triggerable frontend tools)
- Read whole books(ebook or pdf) with this plugin and continue whenever (AI can read out page and shows text in swedish, user simply continues)
- AI explains a topic based on a topic (eg swedish history or christmas traditions)
- SilentReading: Story length is adjustable
- Flashcard training: Think about something that keyboard navigation is possible from the beginning for showing cards (setting focus on iframe does not work. Maybe via postmessage or button saying activate keyboard which does nothing but setting the focus on the iframe)

### Other enhancements

- Listing of cards in a deck
- Import card from Anki
- Having a wiki for useful info about learning swedish maybe librelingo

--------------------OLD IDEAS-------------------------------

### Stage 2 - AI story generator based on flahcards

- 10-20% are new words

### Stage 3 - Ansagen

- where audio plays or where it should be translated
- AI sidebar to support with tips
- AI validates result and gives tips on how to fix grammar challenge (from Rimori Story)

### Stage 4 - AI discussions

- From rimori discussions having discussions about different topics in swedish

### Stage 5 - Pronounciaation

- Read text and AI tells how well you did and helps to speak it out the right way
- Basically it shows the text, the user reads aloud and then the ai shows for every word how to make it better
- For local dialect the user could maybe change the phonetics of the sentence to add the withed dialect
- Let user play how it should sound and how the user spoke it out next to each other like "Heeeey" vs "Hej"
- https://thefluent.me/api/docs#score

### Additional ideas (notes)

Based on Anki text you have to write a diktat /text

isolated-vm - npm
https://www.npmjs.com/package/isolated-vm

GitHub - kantord/LibreLingo: üê¢ üåé üìö a community-owned language-learning platform
https://github.com/kantord/LibreLingo

Plugin for SFI podd where it scraps the content and shows it as list where you can listen to every and then check it off. Ai sidebar to understand it better and right click to add it to flashcards

Add to dictionary
Right click explain
Right click find eselsbr√ºcke
Right click translate are global plug-ins which plug-ins can configure to allow/forbid
Add decimated actions like prompt template for highlighted word
Based on service workers global actions can be added to context menu

Maybe backend api for general plugin data needed. Like when a plugin scraps als Sfi podcasts and adds them to the db.

## Core libraries

https://www.npmjs.com/package/anki-reader

## Notes

Maybe integrate Lingq https://www.lingq.com/apidocs/

Maybe implement a plugin similar to https://github.com/LuteOrg/lute-v3

A translation can be made with https://readloud.net/

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

3. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
